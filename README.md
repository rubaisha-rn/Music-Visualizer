# Music-Visualizer
This video showcases the full range of visualisation modes created for the Introduction to Programming II project at the University of London. Each of the eight modes uniquely responds to a specific audio feature — such as amplitude, bass, or treble — and translates it into real-time visual patterns.

From smooth waveform animations to bold geometric bursts, each visualisation offers a different artistic interpretation of the music’s flow. Designed and programmed entirely in JavaScript, this creative coding project merges art, sound, and interactivity into one immersive experience.
